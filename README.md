üíª Laptop Sentiment Analysis AI
A Python-based sentiment analysis project that classifies laptop reviews using natural language processing and machine learning. The model leverages pre-trained GloVe 100d word embeddings and showcases data processing, classification, and evaluation.

üß© Installation
1. Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/PanasheTapfumaneyi/LaptopSentimentAnalysis-AI.git
`
2. Enter project directory
`cd LaptopSentimentAnalysis-AI
`
4. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
`python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
`
5. Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt
`
üåê Download & Add GloVe 100d Embeddings
To run the model, you must download and include the pre-trained GloVe 100-dimensional embeddings:

1. Download embeddings
Visit the GloVe project page and download glove.6B.zip, which includes glove.6B.100d.txt

2. Extract the file
`unzip glove.6B.zip
`

3. Place in project folder
Move glove.6B.100d.txt into the project directory, e.g.:
`mv glove.6B.100d.txt LaptopSentimentAnalysis-AI/
`

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
1. Prepare the embeddings loader
Make sure your code points to glove.6B.100d.txt and uses it to create an embeddings index (via gensim or custom parser). Example structure:
`embeddings_index = {}
with open('glove.6B.100d.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    for line in f:
        values = line.split()
        word, coeffs = values[0], values[1:]
        embeddings_index[word] = np.asarray(coeffs, dtype='float32')
`

2. Run the sentiment analysis script
`python run_analysis.py
`
3. This script handles data preprocessing, feature extraction using GloVe embeddings, model training, and evaluation.

4. Evaluate outputs

Review classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Sample results are printed in the terminal or saved in output files/logs.
